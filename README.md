Had to re-intialize my git repo cause of netlify error which made it refuse to launch my site. Online guids suggested this coarse of action.

Ok turns out the proplems were connected to my next js just not being properly intalled for some reason. Had to uninstall it and then reinstal.
That's 3 hours of my life gone... fml.
